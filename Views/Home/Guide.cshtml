<h1>Get started with Xmonad</h1>

<p>
    xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximizing screen use. <br>
     Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard: a mouse is optional. <br>
xmonad is written, configured and extensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other extensions may be written by the user in configuration files. <br>

Layouts are applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on several physical screens. <br>
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> 
   
    
  
    <code>
        <h4>For debain/Ubuntu</h4>
        <p>sudo apt install ghc libghc-xmonad-contrib-dev xmonad xmobar </p> <br>
    </code>

    <code>
        <h4>For arch </h4>
        <p> sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar ghc</p> <br>
    </code>

    <p> now that we have xmonad installed lets get started with the configuration</p>

    <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
    Create the ~/.xmonad directory and the ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs file and edit it as described below. <br>

After changes to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs are made, use the Mod+q shortcut to recompile and have them take effect. <br>
